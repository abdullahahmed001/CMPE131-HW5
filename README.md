## Question 1) Define the following unit, integration, regression tests and when you would use each?
- Unit test: Unit testing is when we are testing a small piece of code within a larger application and we would use this type of testing when we are either fixing bugs or adding new functions to our program. 
- Integration test: Integration testing is when we are verifying whether multiple components of a system work together correctly. 
- Regression test: A regression test is a test that ensures that new changes in your code doesn't break existing functionality that used to work. 
## Question 2) Briefly explain pytest discovery (file/function naming) and what a fixture is.
Pytest discovery is when pytest automatically discovers your files and functions based on simple naming conventions and is able to execute them. Next, a fixture is a special function in pytest that provides reusbale test data to multiple tests.
